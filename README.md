I realized that half of my services are more or less CRUD services with little to no customization aside from obvious differences, but I still wanted them as seperate stand alone applications, with enough espresso and liquor anything is possible.

go run main.go --conf testAppConfig.js

Very straightforward json file configurations, i'll start getting real documentation together for it at some point soon.
